# Churn Probability Prediction for a Gym
* Tecnologias utilizadas: Python ( Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy cluster)
Se clasificaron a los clientes de un gimnasio en grupos de acuerdo a par√°metros espec√≠ficos y se calcul√≥ la probabilidad de que estos dejaran de ser clientes.
## Brief Description:
This project aimed to identify operators who did not meet certain performance criteria for a telecom company.
To identify inefficient operators, average parameters were defined among them, such as:
The average number of calls per operator
The average waiting times for each operator
The average number of outgoing calls per operator
Based on these parameters, each operator was analyzed to verify whether their metrics were below average.
## üõ†Ô∏èTechnologies Used: 
* Python: Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, clustering
*  Tableau.
*  Jupyter Notebooks
## Key Responsibilities:
Classified gym customers into groups based on specific parameters and calculated the probability of churn.
## Impact / Achievements:
Identified customer groups and their likelihood of contract cancellation.
Summary of Key Insights:
Short contracts (<2 months) are strongly linked to cancellations.

Longer membership duration (avg. 4.7 months) increases the likelihood of staying.

Group class participation (46.4%) boosts retention.

Proximity to the gym (87.3%) is a major factor in keeping customers.

These factors help predict the likelihood of customer churn and guide strategies to improve retention.
